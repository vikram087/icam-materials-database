[('The kinetic inductance properties of a thin superconducting sample of BSCCO-2223 compound is studied. A strong dependence of kinetic inductance with the variation of applied magnetic field is found at low temperature in the superconducting state. The kinetic inductance of a thin superconductor increases linearly with increasing magnetic field. This behavior is used for designing a superconducting modulator circuit. This behavior can be useful for device applications and designing of superconducting electronic circuits like superconducting power amplifier, superconducting transmitter and superconducting ac current controller.', {'entities': [(4, 21, 'PROPERTY'), (104, 187, 'PROPERTY'), (224, 244, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (39, 65, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (295, 343, 'PROPERTY'), (372, 416, 'APPLICATION'), (475, 559, 'APPLICATION'), (562, 588, 'APPLICATION'), (594, 630, 'APPLICATION')]})]
