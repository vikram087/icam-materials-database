Interestingly, we found that annealing in N2 also leads to superconductivity enhancement, similar to the annealing effects of O2, I2 and air. However, vacuum annealing does not enhance superconductivity, which indicates that the enhanced superconductivity in O2-, N2-, I2- and air-annealed samples is not due to improved homogeneity. In addition, we have treated the underdoped samples with nitric acid, which is found to enhance superconductivity as well. Our analyses of these results support the argument that the superconductivity enhancement, caused either by annealing or nitric acid treatment, originates from the variation of interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe, which is destructive to superconducting pairing, can be reduced by annealing in oxidation agents or nitric acid treatment.

Superconductivity could be induced in topological materials through applying pressure as well. for example, a pressure-induced superconducting phase was found in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$.

In this review, we will discuss about another novel way of inducing superconductivity in a non-superconducting topological material -- by creating a mesoscopic interface on the material with a non-superconducting, normal metallic tip where the mesoscopic interface becomes superconducting. Such a phase is now known as a tip-induced superconducting (TISC) phase. This was first seen in 2014 on Cd$_3$As$_2$ at IISER Mohali, India. Following that, a large number of other topological materials were shown to display TISC. Since the TISC phase emerges only at a confined region under a mesoscopic point contact, traditional bulk tools for characterizing superconductivity cannot be employed to detect/confirm such a phase. On the other hand, such a point contact geometry is ideal for probing the possible existence of a temperature and magnetic field dependent superconducting energy gap and a temperature and magnetic field dependent critical current.

The discovery of high temperature superconductivity with a superconducting gap of ~20 meV in 1UC-FeSe/STO has stimulated tremendous interest in superconductivity community, for it opens new avenue for both raising superconducting transition temperature and understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional high temperature superconductivity. Here, we review mainly the experimental progress on interface enhanced superconductivity in the three systems mentioned above with emphasis on 1UC-FeSe/STO, studied by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport experiments. We discuss the roles of interfaces and possible pairing mechanism inferred from those studies.', {'entities': [(765, 766, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (420, 427, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (827, 830, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (832, 846, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (919, 948, 'PROPERTY'), (472, 505, 'APPLICATION'), (510, 543, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (736, 790, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (796, 857, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (545, 561, 'SYNTHESIS_METHOD'), (1375, 1416, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (1419, 1459, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (1465, 1485, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD')]}), ('The lack of energy dissipation and abrupt electrical phase transition of superconductors favorite them for nanoscale technologies, including radiation detectors, and quantum technologies. Moreover, understanding the nanoscale behavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of collective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of accessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting properties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and more efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these advantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable speed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are faster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we optimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We showed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) made of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous coexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and efficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the governing mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual superconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and superconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity effect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest that such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting properties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this hybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting films and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near the superconducting-to-insulating transition.', {'entities': [(73, 87, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (4, 29, 'PROPERTY'), (35, 68, 'PROPERTY'), (107, 128, 'APPLICATION'), (141, 159, 'APPLICATION'), (166, 185, 'APPLICATION'), (507, 569, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (565, 587, 'PROPERTY'), (589, 613, 'PROPERTY'), (356, 399, 'PROPERTY'), (740, 762, 'PROPERTY'), (790, 807, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (589, 594, 'PROPERTY'), (842, 860, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (600, 613, 'PROPERTY'), (900, 938, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (947, 961, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (1052, 1073, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (1080, 1099, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (974, 1042, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (1134, 1186, 'PROPERTY'), (1192, 1228, 'PROPERTY'), (1326, 1354, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (1357, 1380, 'PROPERTY'), (1407, 1439, 'PROPERTY'), (1475, 1490, 'PROPERTY'), (1745, 1763, 'PROPERTY'), (1867, 1906, 'PHASE_LABEL')]}), ('We report the appearance of superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure (0.35 to 2.5GPa) in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 with RE = Ce, Nd, Pr and Sm.

Its prediction and the experimental discovery became a breakthrough in our understanding of superconductivity and founded a new direction in physics. Here we show that the interplay between the superconducting order parameter and elastic fields, which are intimately connected to the very existence of the superconductivity itself, can result in a novel superconducting state dual to the Abrikosov state: a regular texture of superconducting islands. The fact that both patterns emerge within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau description of superconductivity indicates that the formation of regular structures may be a generic feature of any phase transition. Emergence of superconducting island arrays is not specific to the effect of the elastic forces, but can be caused by any inherent mechanism generating long-range non-local interactions in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, for example, by the Coulomb forces. In particular, our findings suggest the formation of a superconducting island textures as a scenario for a superconductor-to-insulator transition in thin films.', {'entities': [(710, 758, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (109, 136, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (1377, 1434, 'APPLICATION'), (165, 286, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR')]}), ('A diagrammatic approach based on thermal Green function to superconducting fluctuation transport is reviewed keeping consistency with Ginzburg-Landau theory.

When a magnetic field is applied to a superconducting body it also starts to spin (gyromagnetic effect), and when a normal metal in a magnetic field becomes superconducting and expels the magnetic field (Meissner effect) the body also starts to spin. Yet according to the conventional theory of superconductivity the electron\'s spin only role is to label states, and the electron\'s magnetic moment plays no role in superconductivity. Instead, within the unconventional theory of hole superconductivity, the electron\'s spin and associated magnetic moment play a fundamental role in superconductivity.
