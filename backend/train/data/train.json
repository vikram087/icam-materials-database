[('In topological materials, Dirac fermions can split into two Weyl fermions with opposite chiralities due to the breaking of space inversion symmetry, while in non-centrosymmetric superconductors, novel superconducting electron pairing mechanisms arise because of the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we report the pressure-introduced superconductivity in a typical noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal LaAlX (X=Si and Ge).

Furthermore, the application of pressure does not destroy the nontrivial band topology of LaAlSi up to 80.4 GPa, making such materials as potential candidates for realizing topological superconductivity.

The latter case typically leads to the superconducting gap switching its sign among different sections of the Fermi surface. In iron pnictides, the natural scenario is that the gap changes sign between the hole and the electron Fermi surfaces.

This is a clear contrast to the model under the longitudinal magnetic fields, where there are no noticeable superconducting correlations. Competitions between the transverse magnetic field and the Kondo singlet formation lead to this enhanced superconducting correlations. For the spin-1 model, the single-ion anisotropy suppresses the superconducting correlation and there is no noticeable enhancement. We also examine the large Kondo exchange coupling limit.

Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulations in the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates. Further analysis shows that the maxima and minima in the superconductivity modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the Te/Se atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the Te/Se atoms in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films grown on SrTiO3(001).

The discovery that it develops only when superconductivity fades away and near the same 1/8th hole doping as in La2-xBaxCuO4 suggests that charge order, although visibly pinned by CuO chains in YBa2Cu3Oy, is an intrinsic propensity of the superconducting planes of high Tc cuprates.', {'entities': [(62, 106, 'PROPERTY'), (62, 106, 'APPLICATION'), (156, 190, 'PROPERTY'), (262, 269, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (215, 242, 'PROPERTY'), (510, 520, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (533, 552, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (557, 565, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (582, 586, 'PROPERTY'), (729, 754, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (90, 106, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (836, 845, 'PROPERTY'), (894, 899, 'PROPERTY'), (902, 915, 'PROPERTY'), (918, 949, 'PROPERTY'), (90, 106, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (855, 865, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (1072, 1093, 'PROPERTY'), (90, 106, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (1238, 1249, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (1214, 1230, 'PROPERTY'), (1306, 1315, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL')]}), ('The nature of the underdoped pseudogap regime of the high-temperature superconductors has been a matter of long-term debate.

In recent years, a new and promising route for realizing topological superconductors has opened due to advances in the field of topological insulators. Current proposals are based on semiconductor heterostructures, where spin-orbit coupled bands are split by a band gap or Zeeman field and superconductivity is induced by proximity to a conventional superconductor.

Each band contributes to the Cooper instability and exhibits a superconducting gap in the energy spectrum. The theory presented below predicts maxima in dependence of Tc(n)-the transition temperature on n, the number of electrons owing to the following mechanism. Doping by electrons increases density of states at the Fermi surface and Tc initially grows up. At the same time, screening on the part of accumulating charges tends to reduce amplitude of the electrical fields inherent in LO phonon modes and at larger concentrations the matrix element of interaction between electrons and LO phonons decreases.

These are carried out over the pressure (and temperature) conditions where molecular dissociation is expected to first occur in the solid phase.

For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the plaquette state constrains the magnitude of $T_c$ for large pairing interactions and may be viewed as a strong-coupling parent state of $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders.

Insights into the spatial hole-distribution in SC samples, provided by monochromated EELS and total reflection-hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, suggest that this particular distribution might be directly influencing superconductivity.', {'entities': [(587, 611, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (27, 43, 'PROPERTY'), (916, 935, 'PROPERTY'), (1202, 1226, 'PROPERTY'), (1065, 1093, 'APPLICATION'), (527, 542, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (690, 705, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (571, 619, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (841, 862, 'SYNTHESIS_METHOD'), (373, 426, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (429, 472, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (474, 499, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (1255, 1272, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD'), (1278, 1331, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD')]}), ('We attain a renormalized and iterative expression of the Andreev level in a quantum-dot Josephson junction, which is bound to have significant implications due to several significant advantages. The renormalized form of the Andreev level not only allows us to extend beyond the limitations of small tunnel coupling, quantum dot energy, magnetic field, and mean-field Coulomb interaction but also enables the capturing of subgap levels that leak out of the superconducting gap into the continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the iterative form of the Andreev level provides an intuitive understanding of the spin-split and superconducting proximity effects of the superconducting leads. We find a singlet-doublet quantum phase transition (QPT) in the ground state due to the intricate competition between the superconducting and spin-split proximity effects, that differs from the typical QPT arising from the competition between the superconducting proximity effect (favoring singlet phase) and the quantum dot Coulomb interaction (favoring doublet phase). This QPT has a diverse phase diagram owing to the spin-split proximity effects which favors the doublet phase akin to the quantum-dot Coulomb interaction but can be also enhanced by the tunneling coupling like the superconducting proximity effect. Unlike the typical QPT, where tunnel coupling prefers singlet ground state, this novel QPT enables strong tunnel coupling to suppress the singlet ground state via the spin-split proximity effect, allowing a singlet-doublet-singlet transition with increasing tunnel coupling. Our renormalized and iterative formalism of the Andreev level is crucial for the electrostatic gate, external flux, and magnetic field modulations of the Andreev qubits.', {'entities': []}), ('Combining spin textures in ultra-thin films with conventional superconductors has emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for designing topologically non-trivial superconducting phases as well as spin-triplet Cooper pairs. As a consequence, two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrids (2D MSHs) are promising candidate systems to realize devices for topology-based quantum technologies and superconducting spintronics. So far, studies have focused mostly on systems hosting collinear ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. However, topologically non-trivial phases have been predicted to emerge in MSH systems with non-collinear spin textures as well. In this article, we present the experimental discovery of topological superconductivity in the MSH system Fe/Ta(110) where a magnetic spiral is realized in the Fe monolayer on the surface of the s-wave superconductor Ta. By combining low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements with theoretical modeling, we are able to conclude that the system is in a topological nodal-point superconducting phase with low-energy edge modes. Due to the non-collinear spin texture in our MSH system, these edge modes exhibit a magnetization direction-dependent dispersion. Furthermore, we identify direct signatures of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the experimentally measured differential tunneling conductance.

These properties are considered as interconnected manifestations of the same phenomenon: We argue that superconductivity occurs in the both cases because the charge carriers (i.e., electrons or holes) exchange {\\it fracton excitations}, quantum oscillations of fractal lattices that mimic the complex microscopic organization of the strange superconductors. For the copper oxides, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ as predicted by the fracton mechanism is of the order of $\\sim 150$ K. We suggest that the marginal ingredient of the high-temperature superconducting phase is provided by fracton coupled holes that condensate in the conducting copper-oxygen planes owing to the intrinsic field-effect-transistor configuration of the cuprate compounds. For the gate-induced superconducting phase in the electron-doped polymers, we simultaneously find a rather modest transition temperature of $\\sim (2-3)$ K owing to the limitations imposed by the electron tunneling processes on a fractal geometry. We speculate that hole-type superconductivity observes larger onset temperatures when compared to its electron-type counterpart.

Instead of using the conventional bromine-acetonitrile mixture for sodium deintercalation, we use an aqueous bromine solution. Using this method, we oxidize the sample to a point that the sodium cobaltate becomes unstable, leading to formation of other products if not controlled. This compound has the same structure as the reported superconductor, yet it exhibits a systematic variation of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) as a function of time. Immediately after synthesis, this compound is not a superconductor, even though it contains appropriate amounts of sodium and water. The samples become superconducting with low Tc values after ~ 90 h. Tc continually increases until it reaches a maximum value (4.5 K) after about 260 h. Then Tc drops drastically, becoming non-superconducting approximately 100 h later. Corresponding time-dependent neutron powder diffraction data shows that the changes in superconductivity exhibited by the metastable cobaltate correspond to slow formation of oxygen vacancies in the CoO2 layers. In effect, the formation of these defects continually reduces the cobalt oxidation state causing the sample to evolve through its superconducting life cycle. Thus, the dome-shaped superconducting phase diagram is mapped as a function of cobalt oxidation state using a single sample. The width of this dome based on the formal oxidation state of cobalt is very narrow - approximately 0.1 valence units wide. Interestingly, the maximum Tc in NaxCoO2*yH2O occurs when the cobalt oxidation state is near 3.5. Thus, we speculate that the maximum Tc occurs near the charge ordered insulating state that correlates with the average cobalt oxidation state of 3.5.', {'entities': [(324, 339, 'INORGANIC_MATERIAL'), (528, 574, 'PROPERTY'), (1246, 1267, 'PROPERTY'), (89, 102, 'APPLICATION'), (921, 939, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (28, 42, 'PHASE_LABEL'), (60, 102, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (1448, 1460, 'SAMPLE_DESCRIPTOR'), (170, 224, 'SYNTHESIS_METHOD'), (237, 260, 'SYNTHESIS_METHOD'), (982, 1022, 'CHARACTERIZATION_METHOD')]}), ('It is generally believed that superconductivity and magnetism are two antagonistic long-range phenomena.

To check the validity of this claim, we study d-wave superconductivity on the checkerboard Hubbard model on a square lattice using the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field theory method with an exact diagonalization solver at zero temperature. The d-wave order parameter is computed for various inhomogeneity levels over the entire doping range of interest in both strong and weak coupling regimes. At a given doping, the size of the d-wave order parameter manifests itself directly in the height of the coherence peaks and hence is an appropriate measure of the strength of superconductivity. The weak coupling results reveal a suppression of the order parameter in the presence of inhomogeneity for small to intermediate hole dopings, while it is enhanced for large dopings. In contrast, for strong coupling there is a monotonic decrease in the maximum amplitude of the superconducting order parameter with inhomogeneity over the entire doping range of interest. Furthermore, at moderately high inhomogeneity, the system undergoes a first-order transition from the superconducting to the normal state in the underdoped regime. In the overdoped regime, the change in the value of the superconducting order parameter correlates with the height of the lowest energy peak in the spectral weight of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, confirming the connection between antiferromagnetic fluctuations and d-wave superconductivity found in earlier studies on the homogeneous case.
