Abstract: The kinetic inductance properties of a thin superconducting sample of
BSCCO-2223 compound is studied. A strong dependence of kinetic inductance with
the variation of applied magnetic field is found at low temperature in the
superconducting state. The kinetic inductance of a thin superconductor
increases linearly with increasing magnetic field. This behavior is used for
designing a superconducting modulator circuit. This behavior can be useful for
device applications and designing of superconducting electronic circuits like
superconducting power amplifier, superconducting transmitter and
superconducting ac current controller.

Abstract: Reentrant superconductivity has been observed in the candidate spin-triplet
superconductor UTe$_2$ as a function of the magnetic field applied along the
hard axis. Resistivity measurements have shown, a broadened superconducting
transition appears near the minimal $T_c$, highlighting the importance of
superconducting fluctuations in this regime. We present a phenomenological
study assuming a field-driven first-order transition between two
superconducting states. We show that with quenched randomness,
inhomogeneity-enhanced superconducting fluctuations near the transition could
naturally account for both the reentrant superconductivity as well as the
broadened superconducting transition.

Abstract: Superconductors lacking both inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry
have been attracting much attention as a platform for exotic superconducting
phases and anomalous phenomena, including the superconducting diode effect.
Recent studies revealed intrinsic phases with this symmetry, named anapole
superconductivity and monopole superconductivity, which are $PT$-symmetric
superconducting states with and without Cooper pairs' total momentum,
respectively. To explore characteristic phenomena in these states, we calculate
and predict the superconducting piezoelectric effect and superconducting diode
effect. A close relationship with the finite-$q$ pairing, asymmetric Bogoliubov
spectrum, and quantum geometry is discussed. This study reveals the
piezoelectric and diode effects as potential probes to elucidate exotic
superconducting phases.

Abstract: The Z = 12.67 family of materials includes CaBeSi and NaAlSi which have been
reported as non-superconducting and superconducting respectively. We show with
an algorithm how to generate other members of this family. We discover through
the material specific characterization dataset (MSCD) scheme and the symmetry
conditions for superconductivity, why some are superconducting and others may
not be superconducting.We estimate too the Tcs of members of this interesting
family of materials.

Abstract: The complete scenario of high-Tc superconductivity based on experimental data
from electron-tunneling spectroscopy on underdoped, overdoped and Ni-doped
Bi2212 single crystals using a break-junction technique is presented. There are
two different types of superconductivity in cuprates: superconductivity due to
pairing of spinons on charged stripes and magnetic superconductivity mediated
by spin-waves. The coherent state of the spinon superconductivity is
established via the magnetic superconductivity. In NCCO, there is only the
spinon superconductivity and the coherent state is established due to the
Josephson coupling between charged stripes. Below Tc, we observe four different
gaps, namely, (i) a SDW gap due to antiferromagnetic correlations; (ii) a
superconducting gap due to spinon pairing; (iii) a d-wave magnetic
superconducting gap, and (iv) a small superconducting gap most likely having
g-wave symmetry. We show that the d-wave superconductivity is mediated by
spin-waves and the magnitude of the superconducting gap due to pairing of
spinons is larger than the magnitude of the d-wave gap, however, the d-wave gap
is more intense. The superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons most likely
has a s-wave symmetry. The maximum magnitudes of the SDW, the spinon and d-wave
gaps are located at (p/2, p/2), (p/2, p/2) and (p, 0) on the Fermi surface,
respectively. The d-g-wave superconductivity mediated by spin-waves can be
considered as a pairing of magnetic polarons. We formulate a theorem for
cuprates by analogy with the Anderson's theorem for classical superconductors.
The presented model of high-Tc superconductivity naturally explains other
experimental data.

Abstract: The superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) recently attract considerable
attention due to their exciting properties, such as the robustness of
superconductivity against atomic disorder and extremely high-pressure. The
well-studied crystal structure of superconducting HEAs is body-centered-cubic
(bcc) containing Nb, Ti, and Zr atoms. The same elements are contained in
Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, which is a recently discovered bcc HEA and shows a
gum-metal-like behavior after cold rolling. The gum metal is also an
interesting system, exhibiting superelasticity and low Young's modulus. If gum
metals show superconductivity and can be used as a superconducting wire, the
gum-metal HEA superconductors might be the next-generation superconducting wire
materials. Aiming at a fundamental assessment of as-cast Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr
multicomponent alloys including Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, we have investigated the
structural and superconducting properties of the alloys. All alloys
investigated show the superconductivity, and the valence electron concentration
dependence of the superconducting critical temperature is very close to those
of typical superconducting bcc HEAs.

Abstract: We analyze the enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature of
superconducting/ferromagnetic bilayers due to the appearance of localized
superconducting states in the vicinity of magnetic domain walls in the
ferromagnet. We consider the case when the main mechanism of the
superconductivity destruction via the proximity effect is the exchange field.
We demonstrate that the influence of the domain walls on the superconducting
properties of the bilayer may be quite strong if the domain wall thickness is
of the order of superconducting coherence length.

Abstract: Following our previous investigations on superconductivity in amorphous
carbon (aC) based systems; we have prepared thin composite aC-W films using
electron-beam induced deposition. The films did not show any sign for
superconductivity above 5 K. However, local, non-percolative, superconductivity
emerged at Tc = 34.4 K after treatment with sulfur at 250 C for 24 hours. The
superconducting features in the magnetization curves were by far sharper
compared to our previous results, and the shielding fraction increased by about
an order of magnitude. Our data suggest that pairing and localized
superconductivity take place in the aC-S regions, whereas phase coherence,
assisted by the W inclusions, was enhanced compared to our previous samples,
yet still not to the degree of achieving global phase-coherence and percolating
superconductivity.

Abstract: Platinum-group transition-metal dichalcogenides have emerged as a subject of
considerable interest in condensed matter physics due to their remarkable
topological properties and unconventional superconducting behavior. In this
study, we report the synthesis and superconducting characteristics of a new
Dirac-type topological semimetallic compound 1$T$-RhSeTe. It shows type-II
superconductivity with a superconducting transition temperature of 4.72 K and a
high upper critical field. The coexistence of superconductivity and topological
properties makes it a prime candidate for hosting topological
superconductivity.
